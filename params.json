A cappella groups have a problem: one group might be working with 40 or more songs at any given time, with rep lists and sheet music scattered across handwritten notes, iPhone documents, old books, and more. Pitchslapp is an iOS and Web app that takes all this information, puts it in one place,and syncs it between all the members of your group. You can search your full rep by soloist or user-set tags, build a setlist for an upcoming gig, and even play the starting pitch for each song during a performance. Pitchslapp takes the pain out of managing your rep so you can focus on sounding good!",
